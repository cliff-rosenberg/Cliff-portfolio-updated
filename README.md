# My Web Portfolio page

## What this is:

This is my updated personal portfolio page. It has been restyled a bit to help with presenting more of my recently completed projects. These kind of things are probably always going to be a "work in progress" as new technologies are learned and then applied!

## Installation

Theres no installation needed, I have the page hosted here at Github.
